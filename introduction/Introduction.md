# Data basics

## Types of variables

The first step is identify the type of your variable.

### Numerical

**Quantitative**
Take on numerical values sensible to add, subtract, take avarage, etc. with these values.

* Continous
Take on any of an infinitive number of values within a given range.

*(-10,10)*

* Discrate
Take on one of specific set of numeric values.

*{0,1,2,3,4,5}*

### Categorical

**Qualitative**
Take on a limited number of distinct categories. Categories can be identified with numbers, but not sensible to do arithmetic operations.

* Ordinal

Levels have an inherent ordering.

*{unsatisfied, neutral, satisfied}*

* Regular categorical

Doesn't have an inherent ordering.

## Relationships between variables

The variables are **Associated (dependent)** if them show some connection. The association can be described as *positive* or *negative*. Otherwise, they are **Independent**.
